# Conclusion

After extensively exploring this health risk factors data set provided by the CDC, there are several noteworthy observations that we feel should be highlighted. 

1. The strata ("Race/Ethnicity", "Gender", and "Grade") have some correlation. That is, while exploring each of these strata, we ended up with the same conclusions pertaining to trends in the data. This is significant because all of the health risk factors described and plotted throughout this project affect the different strata in very similar ways. There are certainly differences between the sub-stratifications, but overall, the trends are comparable, suggesting that these health factors do not discriminate. 

2. One contradicting discovery was that despite an improvement in average health rates, the average obesity rates continued to worsen. Although this is a very concerning statistic, it provides us with very useful information: there may be a confounding variable contributing to the discrepancy or improving in these 4 health rates may simply not be enough to decrease obesity rates. Whichever of these may be causing the difference, more research must be done regardless.
