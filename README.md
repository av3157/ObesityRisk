With global adolescent obesity rates increasing, this project explores the various factors correlated with obesity rates. Studied factors include grade, gender, race/ethnicity, year, geographic and location. With a better understanding the factors that lead to obesity onset and development, we can also realize potential preventative measures that could reduce or delay onset.
