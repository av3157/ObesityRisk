    "text": "1 Introduction\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the global obesity rate has tripled from 1975 to 2016. In 2016 alone, nearly 2 billion adults (ages 18+), 340 million adolescents (ages 5-19), and 40 million (ages &lt;5) were classified as obese, with these numbers projected to continue steadily increasing. Left ignored, obesity can have several detrimental health consequences including cardiovascular complications, cancers, and Type 2 diabetes.\nFor many, obesity onset occurs at a young age and progressively becomes more difficult to treat with age. According to the CDC, nearly 15 million children were impacted by obesity between 2017-2020, amounting to nearly 20% of the U.S. adolescent population. Breaking this metric down into age groups, ~13% of 2-5 year olds, ~21% of 6-11 year olds, and ~22% of 12-19 year olds were classified as obese. This indicates that the obesity rate has been increasing with respect to adolescent age as well. The CDC also stated that obesity levels differed by other factors, including racial group and gender. Thus, the goal of this project was to explore and analyze the different factors contributing to high childhood obesity levels. Listed below are a few questions that this exploratory analysis aims to answer:\n\nAre certain races more prone to obesity development than others?\nWhat lifestyle choices are correlated with obesity onset?\nHow have the aforementioned factors impacted obesity rates over the course of a decade?\nDoes geographic location of residence impact obesity onset?\n\nWith a better understanding the factors that lead to obesity onset and development, we can also realize potential preventative measures that could reduce or delay onset. In the following section, we chose a dataset that captures the aforementioned information and elaborate on a plan to explore and analyze this data.\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/obesity-health-consequences-of-being-overweight\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html"

    "text": "2.3 Missing Value Analysis\nFirst, to analyze the dataset as a whole, we replaced all empty strings with NA to allow for easier calculation. Then, we ran the plot_missing function on the entire dataset. As seen in the figure below, the “Data_Value_Unit” column has 100% NA values, and thus can be removed entirely. There are a few others columns with a high NA rate, such as “Gender”, “Total”, “Data_Value_Footnote”, etc. The reason that most of the major demographics (i.e. “Gender”, “Race/Ethnicity”, “Grade”) have many NA values is because those specific columns will only contain a value if the observation was stratified by that demographic. For instance, if the data in a row was with regards to the “Gender” percentage of adolescents, the “Gender” column would have a value and the “Race/Ethnicity” and “Grade” columns would be empty. For this reason, the “Stratification1” and “StratificationCategory1” columns have no NA values, since they store this data. Thus, when beginning data analysis, we will remove the “Gender”, “Race/Ethnicity”, “Grade”, “Total”, and other similar columns and only keep the stratified columns.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(DataExplorer)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"obesity_dataset.csv\")\ndata[data==\"\"]&lt;- NA\nplot_missing(data, title = \"Analysis of NA Values\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWith regards to the whole dataset, one of the primary variables of interest is the “Data_Value” variable which indiactes the percentage of students with respect to a category (“Race/Ethnicity”, “Grade”, “Gender”, “Total”) that correspond to the question. For instance, the first row of the dataset has a “LocationDesc” of “Alaska”, “YearStart” and “YearEnd” as “2019”, “Question” of “Percent of students in grades 9-12 who achieve 1 hour or more of moderate-and/or vigorous-intensity physical activity daily” with a “Data_Value” of “9.6” stratified on “Race/Ethnicity” with a value of “Asian”. To break this down, this means that in 2019, 9.6% of Asians in Alaska achieved 1+ hour of moderate-and/or vigorous physical activity daily.\nHowever, some values in the “Data_Value” column are marked as NA. So, even though there is a corresponding state, date, stratification, etc., the value is not given. Thus, we wanted to compare how many NA data values there were in the dataset, and how many values corresponding to other stratificaiton categories there were. The results are shown in the bar graph below.\n\n\nCode\ndata$missing_values &lt;- data$StratificationCategory1\ndata$missing_values[is.na(data$Data_Value)] = 'NA'\n\ndata_subset_1 &lt;- data[data$Data_Value_Footnote != \"\", ]\n\nggplot(data, aes(x=fct_infreq(missing_values))) +\n  geom_bar(fill=\"gray\") +\n  labs(title = \"Frequency of Stratification Categories\", x = \"Categories\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = \"black\", size = 14, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the bar chart above, we can see that there are a little above 10000 data points that do not have a given data value, and will be removed prior to analysis. This is corroborated by our first plot which shows 26.53% NA values for the “Data_Value” column."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nFor this project, we will be using data from the CDC pertaining to youth health risk factors. The specific risk factors that we will be exploring are nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. The data is being collected by the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, a set of surveys that tracks behaviors that can lead to poor health for students in high school (9th-12th grade). The data is owned by the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO). Our data was created on July 22, 2016, last updated on January 29, 2021, and the meta-data was last updated on August 25, 2023.\nThere are 31 columns and 40,100 rows in this data set as of the last update. The data contains a mix of strings and floats. Some of the columns that we plan to use in our analysis include “YearStart”, “YearEnd”, “LocationAbbr”, “Topic”, “Question”, “Data_Value”, “Sample_Size”, “Total”, “Gender”, “Grade”, and “Race/Ethnicity”. In particular, the “LocationAbbr”, Gender”, “Grade”, and “Race/Ethnicity” columns will inform us of specific demographics of each observation. We will use these to analyze how different demographics are impacted by the youth health risk factors.\nAfter taking a glance at the data, we immediately noticed that there are several “NA” values which will need to be dealt with before analyzing youth risks by the demographics listed above. There are also several columns that will not be needed for our analysis, so we will subset the data so that further data manipulation will be more efficient. We will save the data as a “.csv” file and then import the data using the “read_csv()” function in R.\nSources:\n\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Youth-Risk/vba9-s8jp\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm"

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nSince we will be answering the four questions mentioned in the Introduction, we will break this section into four parts. Our data set contains several columns which will allow us to answer these questions.\n\n2.2.1 Question 1: Stratum vs Obesity Rate\nIn this section, we will tackle the question of whether certain strata (Race, Gender, Grade) are more prone to obesity than others. We will use the “Class”, “Data_Value”, “StratificationCategory1”, and “Stratification1” columns for this analysis. The “Class” column informs us which health risk category the question pertains to; for this question, we will specifically filter for the “Obesity / Weight Status” class. The “Data_Value” column provides us information on the percentage of students that face the specified health risk. The “StratificationCategory1” column contains information on which demographic the data has been stratified on; for this question, we will group by each of the 3 strata (“Race/Ethnicity”, “Gender”, “Grade”) so that we can understand the obesity percentages by stratum. The “Stratification1” category contains data on the specific sub-stratifications for each main stratum. We will create a grid of bar plots using the “ggplot2” library and plot the sub-stratifications on the x-axis and the average obesity rates as a percentage on the y-axis. This will allow us to see which sub-stratification is the most prone to obesity.\n\n\n2.2.2 Question 2: Lifestyle Choices vs Health Status\nIn this section we will tackle the question of how lifestyle choices impact health status. We will use the “Class”, Data_Value”, “StratificationCategory1”, and “Stratification1” columns for this analysis. The “Class” column informs us which health risk category the question pertains to; for this question, we will specifically filter out the “Obesity / Weight Status” class. In other words, we will keep all the rows containing the values “Physical Activity”, “Fruits and Vegetables”, “Sugar Drinks”, and “Television Viewing” since these are specific lifestyle choices. The “Physical Activity” column contains data on the percent of students that achieve at least 1 hour of physical activity per day or participate in physical education in school. The “Fruits and Vegetables” category contains data on the percent of students that consume fruits and veggies less than 1 time a day. The “Sugar Drinks” column contains data on the percent of students that drank soda at least once a day. the “Television Viewing” column contains data on the percent of students that watch at least 3 hours of TV each school day. The “Data_Value” column provides us information on the percentage of students that face the specified health risk. The “StratificationCategory1” column contains information on which demographic the data has been stratified on; for this question, we will group by all 3 strata so that we can understand the health rates by stratum. The “Stratification1” category contains data on the specific sub-stratifications for each main stratum. We will create a bar plot faceted by stratum for each stratum using the “ggplot2” library and plot the lifestyle choices on the x-axis and the health rates as a percentage on the y-axis. This will allow us to see the impact of lifestyle choices by stratum on health rates.\n\n\n2.2.3 Question 3: Changes in Health and Obesity Rates Over Time\nIn this question we will tackle the question of how health and obesity rates change over a decade. We will use the “YearEnd”, Class”, “Data_Value”, “StratificationCategory1”, and “Stratification1” columns for this analysis. The “YearEnd” column tells us which year the data for a specific class, location, and stratification was last collected. The “Class” column informs us which health risk category the question pertains to; for this question, we will use all classes. The “Data_Value” column provides us information on the percentage of students that face the specified health risk. We will use the “StratificationCategory1” and “Stratification1” columns to help understand how strata and sub-strafications impact health and obesity rates over time. We will create line plots using the “ggplot2” library and plot the years on the x-axis and the health/obesity rates on the y-axis. We will also create stacked line plots using the “ggplot2” library to plot change in health/obesity rates over time by strata and sub-stratification. This will allow us to see which health factor(s) incurs the most change in health/obesity rates over time.\n\n\n2.2.4 Question 4: Location vs Obesity Rates\nIn this question we will tackle the question of whether geographic locations of residence impact the onset of obesity. We will use the “Class”, “Data_Value”, and “LocationAbbr” columns for this analysis. The “Class” column informs us which health risk category the question pertains to; for this question, we will specifically filter for the “Obesity / Weight Status” class. The “Data_Value” column provides us information on the percentage of students that face the specified health risk. The “LocationAbbr” column contains state name abbreviations where the data samples were taken from; we will group by this column so that we can observe which states have the highest obesity percentages. We will create a bar plot using the “ggplot2” library and plot the state name abbreviations on the x-axis and the obesity percentages on the y-axis. This will allow us to see which state(s) has the highest obesity rate."

In particular, the “Race/Ethnicity” and “Grade” stratifications have very proportionate data. Similarly, the “Fruits/Veggies” and “Obesity / Weight Status” classes have very similar distributions of data. The mosaic plot also shows that these 4 categories have the most amount of data collected because they have the largest areas. Because the “Obesity / Weight Status” class has a significant amount of data collected, we can be confident in singling out this class when answering some of our questions.\n\n\nCode\nclass_strata &lt;- data_final |&gt; \n  select(YearEnd, Class, `Data_Value`,StratificationCategory1, Stratification1) |&gt;\n  filter(StratificationCategory1 != \"Total\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Class = recode(Class, `Fruits and Vegetables` = 'Fruits/Veggies', `Physical Activity` = 'Phys.

As shown, the “Fruits/Veggies” class contributes to the highest obesity percentages among all strata. Furthermore, the “Obesity / Weight Status” class has the highest density and most amount of data collected, affirming what we saw in the mosaic plot before. [ADD D3 DESCRIPTION HERE]"

As shown, the common factor is that all races appear to have high percentages of low fruit and vegetable intake. The next nearly common factor is that most races have high percentages of excessive time spent watching TV. Finally, most races tend to have higher physical activity than sugary drink intake. These lifestyle choices are clear indicators of poor health and potential causes of further complex health conditions.\n\n\nCode\nlifestyle_gender &lt;- data_final |&gt;\n  select(Class, `Data_Value`, StratificationCategory1, Stratification1) |&gt; \n  filter(Class != \"Obesity / Weight Status\") |&gt; \n  filter(StratificationCategory1 == \"Gender\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Class,Stratification1) |&gt;\n  summarise(\"AVG Health %\" = mean(Data_Value)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Class = recode(Class, `Fruits and Vegetables` = 'Fruits/Veggies', `Physical Activity` = 'Phys.

Similar to the plots above, this one follows most of the trends aforementioned. What this signifies is that there is some correlation between strata, but not the various health factors. This trend was observed in the mosaic plot seen above."

In other words, highschoolers started making better lifestyle choices. After further research, 2005 was known as the year of international sport and physical education. Perhaps this is a reason that after this year, there is a noticeable decline in poor health choices and better overall health rates (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005).\n\n\nCode\nstrat_order &lt;- c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"9th\", \"10th\", \"11th\", \"12th\", \"Non-Hispanic Black\", \"American Indian/Alaska Native\", \"Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\", \"Hispanic\", \"2 or more races\", \"Non-Hispanic White\", \"Asian\",\"Total Average\")\nsubstrats &lt;- class_year |&gt; \n  group_by(StratificationCategory1, Stratification1, YearEnd) |&gt; \n  summarise(\"AVG Health %\" = mean(`Data_Value`)) \n\ntotal_trend &lt;- aggregate(`AVG Health %` ~ YearEnd + StratificationCategory1, data = substrats, FUN = mean)\n\nggplot(substrats, aes(x=YearEnd, y=`AVG Health %`, color=Stratification1)) +\n  geom_line(stat=\"identity\") +\n  facet_grid(~StratificationCategory1) + \n  scale_color_manual(breaks=strat_order, values=c(\"violet\",\"magenta\",\"red\",\"orange\",\"yellow\",\"green\",\"cyan\",\"cornflowerblue\",\"blue\",\"darkblue\",\"purple\",\"brown\",\"grey\",\"black\")) + \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, color=\"black\", size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size=14),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size=14),\n        axis.text = element_text(size=12)) +\n  geom_line(data = total_trend, aes(x=YearEnd, y=`AVG Health %`, color=\"Total Average\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title=\"Change of Health Rates over time by Strata\", x=\"Year\", y=\"Average Health Rate (%)\", color=\"Sub-Stratifications\") \n\n\n\n\n\nThis stacked line plot, faceted by strata, shows how average health rates for each sub-stratification change over time. As expected, these sub-stratifications follow a similar trend of the previous line plot. One important feature of this graph is the dashed line, which represents the total average health rate for each stratum; in other words, it is the mean of the average health rates for each stratum. Lines that are above the dashed line are worse than the average and lines that lie below the dashed line are better than the average. Most notably, females, 12th graders, and Asian highschoolers had the best lifestyle choices. On the other hand, males, 9th graders, and Non-Hispanic Black highschoolers had the worst lifestyle choices.\n\n\nCode\nobesity_time &lt;- data_final |&gt; \n  select(YearEnd, Class, `Data_Value`, StratificationCategory1, Stratification1) |&gt;\n  filter(StratificationCategory1 != \"Total\") |&gt;\n  filter(Class == \"Obesity / Weight Status\")\n\nyears_obese &lt;- obesity_time |&gt; \n  group_by(YearEnd) |&gt; \n  summarise(\"AVG Obesity %\" = mean(`Data_Value`))\nggplot(years_obese, aes(x=YearEnd, y=`AVG Obesity %`)) +\n  geom_line(stat=\"identity\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, color=\"black\", size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size=14),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size=14),\n        axis.text = element_text(size=12)) +\n  labs(title=\"Change of Obesity Rates over time\", x=\"Year\", y=\"Average Obesity Rate (%)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in this plot, the obesity rates increase over the years, despite the trend of improving health rates. Although these results appear to contradict themselves, there is one possible explanation that could explain the discrepancy. Though health rates and obesity rates may seem correlated, there may be a confounding variable that is contributing to both rates, causing the negative, unexpected correlation. Between 2007, 2009 and 2011, 2013 there are slight decreases in average obesity rates, but everywhere else the average obesity rates are increasing.\n\n\nCode\nstrat_order &lt;- c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"9th\", \"10th\", \"11th\", \"12th\", \"Non-Hispanic Black\", \"American Indian/Alaska Native\", \"Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\", \"Hispanic\", \"2 or more races\", \"Non-Hispanic White\", \"Asian\",\"Total Average\")\nsubstrats_obese &lt;- obesity_time |&gt; \n  group_by(StratificationCategory1, Stratification1, YearEnd) |&gt; \n  summarise(\"AVG Obesity %\" = mean(`Data_Value`)) \n\ntotal_trend &lt;- aggregate(`AVG Obesity %` ~ YearEnd + StratificationCategory1, data = substrats_obese, FUN = mean)\n\nggplot(substrats_obese, aes(x=YearEnd, y=`AVG Obesity %`, color=Stratification1)) +\n  geom_line(stat=\"identity\") +\n  facet_grid(~StratificationCategory1) + \n  scale_color_manual(breaks=strat_order, values=c(\"violet\",\"magenta\",\"red\",\"orange\",\"yellow\",\"green\",\"cyan\",\"cornflowerblue\",\"blue\",\"darkblue\",\"purple\",\"brown\",\"grey\",\"black\")) + \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5, color=\"black\", size=20, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size=14),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size=14),\n        axis.text = element_text(size=12)) +\n  geom_line(data = total_trend, aes(x=YearEnd, y=`AVG Obesity %`, color=\"Total Average\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title=\"Change of Obesity Rates over time by Strata\", x=\"Year\", y=\"Average Obesity Rate (%)\", color=\"Sub-Stratifications\") \n\n\n\n\n\nThis stacked line plot, faceted by strata, shows how average obesity rates for each sub-stratification change over time. Similar to the previous stacked line plot, the dashed line represents the total average obesity rate for each stratum. The “Gender” and “Race/Ethnicity” strata follow similar trends compared to that of the previous stacked line plot. However, the “Grade” class is where the largest difference occurs; all of the grades appear clustered around the average, suggesting that stratifying by grade does not change the average obesity rate by much."

In addition, Males have a higher average obesity rate by approximately 2.5%. Finally, there is an negative correlation between high school students and obesity rates; as the students age, the obesity rates decline."

To analyze how these rates have changed over time, obesity rate data from 2005, 2011, and 2019 were plotted. Hovering over each individual state will give its corresponding obesity percentage and state abbreviation. It is important to note that not every year had data for each state, so hovering over some states will not yield any data. For instance, Washington state did not have data for any of the three years, and is thus white throughout.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata_obesity_population_2005 &lt;- filter(data_final, Stratification1 == \"Total\" & Question == \"Percent of students in grades 9-12 who have obesity\" & YearStart == 2005 & YearEnd == 2005)\ndata_obesity_population_2005$hover &lt;- with(data_obesity_population_2005, paste(LocationDesc, '&lt;br&gt;', \"Percent\", Data_Value))\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n# white border\nl &lt;- list(color = toRGB(\"white\"), width = 1)\n\n# projection options\ng &lt;- list(\n  scope = 'usa',\n  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),\n  showlakes = TRUE,\n  lakecolor = toRGB('white')\n)\n \nplot_ly(data_obesity_population_2005, z = data_obesity_population_2005$Data_Value, hover = data_obesity_population_2005$hover, locations = data_obesity_population_2005$LocationAbbr, type = 'choropleth',\n        locationmode = 'USA-states', color = data_obesity_population_2005$Data_Value, colors = 'Oranges',\n        marker = list(line = l), colorbar = list(title = \"Percentage\")) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = '2005 Obesity Percentage Breakdown by State', geo = g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_obesity_population_2011 &lt;- filter(data_final, Stratification1 == \"Total\" & Question == \"Percent of students in grades 9-12 who have obesity\" & YearStart == 2011 & YearEnd == 2011)\n\ndata_obesity_population_2011$hover &lt;- with(data_obesity_population_2011, paste(LocationDesc, '&lt;br&gt;', \"Percent\", Data_Value))\n \nplot_ly(data_obesity_population_2011, z = data_obesity_population_2011$Data_Value, hover = data_obesity_population_2011$hover, locations = data_obesity_population_2011$LocationAbbr, type = 'choropleth',\n        locationmode = 'USA-states', color = data_obesity_population_2011$Data_Value, colors = 'Purples',\n        marker = list(line = l), colorbar = list(title = \"Percentage\")) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = '2011 Obesity Percentage Breakdown by State', geo = g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_obesity_population &lt;- data_final |&gt;  filter(Stratification1 == \"Total\" & Question == \"Percent of students in grades 9-12 who have obesity\" & YearStart == 2019 & YearEnd == 2019)\ndata_obesity_population$hover &lt;- with(data_obesity_population, paste(LocationDesc, '&lt;br&gt;', \"Percent\", Data_Value))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(data_obesity_population, z = data_obesity_population$Data_Value, hover = data_obesity_population$hover, locations = data_obesity_population$LocationAbbr, type = 'choropleth',\n        locationmode = 'USA-states', color = data_obesity_population$Data_Value, colors = 'Blues',\n        marker = list(line = l), colorbar = list(title = \"Percentage\")) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = '2019 Obesity Percentage Breakdown by State', geo = g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the three plots above, we can see that in general, the highest obesity rates are concentrated within the Midwest/Southern regions. For instance, Arkansas had an obesity rate of 15.3%, 15.2%, and 22.1% in 2005, 2011, and 2019, respectively. These percentages also corresponded to some of the higher obesity rates across the country. It is also noticeable that the overall obesity rates have increased. Looking at the default legends alone, the upper bounds have shifted from 14 to 16 to nearly 23, with the lowerbounds increasing from 6 to 8 to 10. This indicates that across the board, obesity rates have been increasing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After extensively exploring this health risk factors data set provided by the CDC, there are several noteworthy observations that we feel should be highlighted.\n\nThe strata (“Race/Ethnicity”, “Gender”, and “Grade”) have some correlation. That is, while exploring each of these strata, we ended up with the same conclusions pertaining to trends in the data. This is significant because all of the health risk factors described and plotted throughout this project affect the different strata in very similar ways. There are certainly differences between the sub-stratifications, but overall, the trends are comparable, suggesting that these health factors do not discriminate.\nOne contradicting discovery was that despite an improvement in average health rates, the average obesity rates continued to worsen. Although this is a very concerning statistic, it provides us with very useful information: there may be a confounding variable contributing to the discrepancy or improving in these 4 health rates may simply not be enough to decrease obesity rates. Whichever of these may be causing the difference, more research must be done regardless."
